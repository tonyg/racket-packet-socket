# Access to raw Ethernet frames from Racket

If Racket needs a packet from a socket or a port,  
you might just find it's nowhere near as easy as you thought.  
Up in complicated ioctls you'll be caught,  
Ensuring error-freedom is particularly fraught!

Dashing to the rescue is this polished little package:  
A tiny C extension, with a pinch of Racket hackage,  
Relieves you of your burden and returns you to your slackage,  
And competently fixes Racket's packet socket lackage.

## What?

Read and write raw Ethernet frames from Racket programs. 

## How?

```racket
(require packet-socket)

(display (raw-interface-names))
(newline)

(define handle (raw-interface-open "eth0:1"))
(unless handle (error 'example "Couldn't open the device"))

(define packet (raw-interface-read handle)) ;; blocks

(raw-interface-write handle packet)

(raw-interface-close handle)
```

You will need to take care of Ethernet frame headers, footers,
checksums and addressing yourself. You may find the Racket package
[bitsyntax](https://github.com/tonyg/racket-bitsyntax) useful to you
in manipulating binary data structures.

You will also need to give the Racket executable `CAP_NET_RAW`
capability on Linux in order to create packet sockets. One approach to
this could be:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+p+i+e `which racket`
```

Be warned that ethernet has a 64-byte minimum packet size. Less four
bytes for the checksum, two for the ethertype, and twelve for the
sender and target MAC addresses, that leaves 46 bytes of payload in
such a minimum-sized packet. If you are expecting to receive packets
with *fewer than 46 bytes of payload*, then make sure to handle the
zero-padding that gets added to the end by the ethernet! For example,
IPv4 packets have an explicit whole-packet length indicator for just
such a situation.

## Bugs

 - BPF exists not only on OSX, but also on many other BSDs. The
   `#ifdefs` in the support code should be widened to allow it to run
   there as well.
